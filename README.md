- 📊 **Activity monitoring** - Track stars, issues, PRs, forks, etc...
- 🚀 **Diff-based status** - Only see _new_ activity since your last check
- 🎯 **Configurable events** - Choose which events to track per repository
- 📱 **Clean terminal UI** - Beautiful CLI output with emojis and clear formatting

## Commands

| Command                  | Description                        | Example                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `init`                   | Initialize config file             | `gh oss-watch init`                        |
| `add <repo> [events...]` | Add repo to watch list             | `gh oss-watch add owner/repo stars issues` |
| `set <repo> <events...>` | Configure events for repo          | `gh oss-watch set owner/repo forks`        |
| `remove <repo>`          | Remove repo from watch list        | `gh oss-watch remove owner/repo`           |
| `status`                 | Show new activity since last check | `gh oss-watch status`                      |
| `dashboard`              | Display summary across all repos   | `gh oss-watch dashboard`                   |
| `security`               | Show open Dependabot alerts across repos | `gh oss-watch security --detail`     |

## Event Types

- **`stars`** - Repository stars
- **`issues`** - Issues created/reopened
- **`pull_requests`** - Pull requests opened
- **`forks`** - Repository forks

## Security

`gh oss-watch security` scans your watch list for open Dependabot alerts and prints a
severity-ranked snapshot (a point-in-time view, not a since-last-check diff — an open
alert stays relevant until it's fixed). Add `--detail` for per-alert lines,
`--severity high` to show only alerts at or above a minimum severity, or
`--repo owner/name` to limit to a single watched repo. Repos you can't read alerts on
(un-owned, or with alerts disabled) are listed as skipped. Use `--format json` for
machine-readable output.

```bash
gh oss-watch security                       # severity-ranked summary table
gh oss-watch security --detail              # every alert (package, range, fix, GHSA)
gh oss-watch security --severity high       # only high + critical
gh oss-watch security --repo owner/repo     # a single watched repo
gh oss-watch security --format json         # machine-readable
```

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `~/.gh-oss-watch/config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: facebook/react
    events:
      - stars
      - issues
      - pull_requests
  - repo: microsoft/vscode
    events:
      - stars
      - forks
```
